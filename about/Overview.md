## The Gene Ontology Project
The Gene Ontology (GO) project is a major bioinformatics initiative to develop a computational representation of our evolving knowledge of how genes encode biological functions at the molecular, cellular and tissue system levels. Biological systems are so complex that we need to rely on computers to represent this knowledge. The project has developed formal ontologies that represent over 40,000 biological concepts, and are constantly being revised to reflect new discoveries. To date, these concepts have been used to "annotate" gene functions based on experiments reported in over 100,000 peer-reviewed scientific papers.

The Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) includes groups from around the world that collaborate closely on the development of the Gene Ontology and creation of gene function annotations. [Read more about the GO Consortium member groups, and additional funding for those groups](http://geneontology.org/page/go-consortium-contributors-list).
